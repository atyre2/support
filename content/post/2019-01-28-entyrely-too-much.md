Looking at the fantastic pages put together by everyone else leaves me
agog at the great company here on rbind.io! My own efforts are sporadic
and mostly serve as a vehicle for my own learning about the internet. And oh! 
what a learning process that is. Painfully slow, with many steps sideways and
back. Where are the tags?![^tags] Why are the chapter links in my bookdown book suddenly 404'ing?!![^booklinks]

But, I'm excited to finally announce [EnTyrely Too Much](https://drewtyre.rbind.io) 
after an overly long gestation period. 

## My blogging journey

I started blogging on blogspot.com back in 2008[^old]! [aminpractice.blogspot.com](http://aminpractice.blogspot.com/)
gave me an outlet for a lot of research ideas and thoughts. 
But the longer I blogged, the more often I wanted to include R code and output
in my blog posts. While this was possible, it was very painful. Around 2015 I
was learning about github.com, and starting to use RStudio in my teaching and
research. When I first heard about blogdown I decided to jump ship, and began
trying to set up my first academic blog at (atyre2.github.io)[https://atyre2.github.io]. 
[^tags]: I could have sworn there used to be tags on my posts. They are in the metadata!

[^booklinks]: They came back mysteriously by waiting for a half hour? 

[^old]: yes, I'm old. I won't say how old. You can work it out roughly from my
publication record!
