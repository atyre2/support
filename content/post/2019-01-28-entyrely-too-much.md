Looking at the fantastic pages put together by everyone else leaves me
agog at the great company here on rbind.io! My own efforts are sporadic
and mostly serve as a vehicle for my own learning about the internet. And oh! 
what a learning process that is. Painfully slow, with many steps sideways and
back. Where are the tags?![^tags] Why are the chapter links in my bookdown book suddenly 404'ing?!![^booklinks]

But, I'm excited to finally announce [EnTyrely Too Much](https://drewtyre.rbind.io) 
after an overly long gestation period. 

[^tags]: I could have sworn there used to be tags on my posts. They are in the metadata!

[^booklinks]: They came back mysteriously by waiting for a half hour?
